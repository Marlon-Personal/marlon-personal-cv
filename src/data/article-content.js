        content: [
            `<p>React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and it has become a standard in front-end development. With its ability to handle complex UIs and its large community, React has been used by many developers worldwide. One of the most recent additions to React is the introduction of React Hooks. In this article, we’ll explore why React Hooks are so useful and why you should start using them in your next project.</p>

              <h3>What are React Hooks?</h3>
            
            <p>React Hooks are functions that allow developers to use state and other React features without writing classes. React Hooks allow developers to reuse stateful logic, break down complex components into smaller ones, and make components more reusable. React Hooks are also backward-compatible, which means that they can be used in older React versions.</p>
            
            <p>The most commonly used React Hooks are <code>useState</code>, <code>useEffect</code>, <code>useContext</code>, <code>useReducer</code>, <code>useCallback</code>, <code>useMemo</code>, and <code>useRef</code>. Each of these hooks has a specific purpose, and we’ll cover some of the most popular ones in this article.</p>
            
            <h3>Why Use React Hooks?</h3>
            
            <ol>
                <li><h5>Reusability:</h5> <p>One of the main advantages of using React Hooks is that they enable developers to reuse stateful logic.</p></li>
                <li><h5>Simplify Complex Components:</h5> <p>React Hooks can also help simplify complex components by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable parts.</p></li>
                <li><h5>Better Performance:</h5> <p>Using React Hooks can also improve the performance of your application.</p></li>
                <li><h5>Cleaner Code:</h5><p> React Hooks can help you write cleaner code by reducing the amount of boilerplate code that you need to write.</p></li>
            </ol>
            
              <h3>Examples of React Hooks</h3>
            <h4><code>useState</code></h4>
            
            <p>The <code>useState</code> hook is used to manage state in functional components. Here is an example of how to use the <code>useState</code> hook to create a counter:</p>
            
            
            <h4><code>useEffect</code></h4>
            <p>The <code>useEffect</code> hook is used to handle side effects in functional components. Here is an example of how to use the <code>useEffect</code> hook to fetch data from an API:</p>
            
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            
            <p>React Hooks are a powerful addition to the React library. They allow developers to reuse stateful logic, simplify complex components, improve performance, and write cleaner code. The most commonly used React Hooks are <code>useState</code>, <code>useEffect</code>, <code>useContext</code>, <code>useReducer</code>, <code>useCallback</code>, <code>useMemo</code>, and <code>useRef</code>. By using these hooks, you can write more efficient and maintainable code in your React applications.</p>

        title: 'Javascript Data Types',
        content: [
            `<p>JavaScript is a popular programming language that is used for creating dynamic and interactive websites. One of the key features of JavaScript is its flexible and dynamic data typing system. In JavaScript, there are two categories of data types: primitive and non-primitive data types.</p>

            <h3>Primitive Data Types</h3>

            <p>Primitive data types in JavaScript are the most basic data types. They are immutable, meaning that their value cannot be changed once they are created. There are six primitive data types in JavaScript:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><h5>Number: </h5>The number data type represents both integer and floating-point numbers. For example, 10 and 3.14 are both numbers.</li>

                <li><h5>String:</h5> The string data type represents text. A string is a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes, either single or double. For example, &quot;Hello World&quot; and 'JavaScript' are both strings.</li>

                <li><h5>Boolean:</h5> The boolean data type represents a logical value, either true or false.</li>

                <li><h5>Null:</h5> The null data type represents a deliberate non-value or empty value.</li>

                <li><h5>Undefined:</h5> The undefined data type represents a value that is not yet defined or has no value.</li>

                <li><h5>Symbol:</h5> The symbol data type represents a unique identifier. Symbols are often used to define object properties to avoid naming collisions.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Non-Primitive Data Types</h3>

            <p>Non-primitive data types in JavaScript are complex data types. They are mutable, meaning that their value can be changed after they are created. There are three non-primitive data types in JavaScript:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><h5>Object:</h5> The object data type represents a collection of properties and values. Objects can be created using object literals or constructors. Examples of objects in JavaScript include arrays, functions, and regular expressions.</li>

                <li><h5>Array:</h5> The array data type is a special type of object that represents a list of values. Arrays can contain any data type, including other arrays and objects.</li>

                <li><h5>Function:</h5> The function data type represents a set of instructions that perform a specific task. Functions can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and returned as values from functions.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>

            <p>In summary, JavaScript has six primitive data types and three non-primitive data types. Primitive data types are immutable and include number, string, boolean, null, undefined, and symbol. Non-primitive data types are mutable and include object, array, and function. Understanding the different data types in JavaScript is essential for writing efficient and effective code.</p>
